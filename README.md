Welcome to [Waviez](https://waviez.rabitailleow.repl.co)! This page hosts guides to moderation and trainings.

## Training Guide

**Important concepts**
Use the `!warn` command to warn a user.
The `!unwarn` command is only available to Corporates and the Host.

You should NOT announce anything other than what is listed here. Do NOT announce bold text.

**10 minutes before the training, announce the following.**

Hello, welcome to Waviez trainings. I am the host of this session.

We are at T-10 minutes until training starts. Please remain seated until clearance.

If you have a question, use the `!support` command to call for an Assistant.

Food and drinks are no longer available as you should have ordered them before this time.

I will announce next when the session starts, or if we need to delay. Thank you for being a part of the Waviez community!

**If the server has less than 30 LRs, say the following. You should not delay for more than 10 minutes.**
**If there are still not enough LRs after delaying, make a support ticket in Discord to have corporate cancel. You can not cancel on your own.**

Due to the lack of LRs available, we will be delaying 10 minutes. Thank you for being patient.

**At the time of the training, announce the following.**

Welcome to Waviez trainings. The time is currently *(time)*. Please remain seated for the duration of the announcements.

The support command will now be disabled, and the server will be secured. No new players will be able to join.

If you disconnect during the session, only this server will let you join back. If you are gone for too long, your leave will expire and you will not be able to reconnect.

**Use the `:secure` command to lock the server.**
**Use the `:unsecure` command to unlock the server at the end of the training session.**

During trainings, you should be meeting certain expectations. If you fail to do so, the assistants of your group will warn you and you will possibly fail the session.

If you fail the session, you will be kicked and not able to join back into the server.

While participating, follow the following rules:

Do NOT get up out of your seat unless your trainer tells you to do so.

Do NOT spam in the chat.

Follow ALL trainer instructions and listen closely.

**At this time, use the `!group` command to group the users into their training groups. Do not take too long between this and the next announcement.**

Please remain seated. You are now in your training group.

When the doors open, you may get up and find your trainer in front of the stage.

Your trainer will then bring you to your room. If you are found elsewhere, you will be immediately warned.

Thank you for listening to the rules, punishments, and functions. You may now find your trainer.

**Open the doors, then when all of the trainees are with their trainer, announce the following.**

You may now make your way to the training rooms. Have a great session!

**At the end of the session, if there is no HRD in your server, tell the Guidance corporate to ping a ranker, or call for one in #ranker-requests.**
